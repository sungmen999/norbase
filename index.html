            <h2>Basic block level elements</h2>

            <p class="lead">This is a lead paragraph (<code>p</code> element).
            To add some length to it, let us mention that this page was
            primarily written for testing the effect of <strong>user style sheets</strong>.
            You can use it for various other purposes as well, like just checking how
            your browser displays various HTML elements by default.</p><p>
            It can also be useful when testing conversions from HTML
            format to other formats, since some elements can go wrong then.</p>

            <h3>This is a h3 headline</h3>
            <p>This is another paragraph. I think it needs to be added that
            the set of elements tested is not exhaustive in any sense. I have selected
            those elements for which it can make sense to write user style sheet rules,
            in my opionion.</p>
            <h4>This is a h4 headline</h4>
            <div>This is a <code>div</code> element. Authors may use such elements instead
            of paragraph markup for various reasons. (End of <code>div</code>.)</div>
            <blockquote><p>This is a block quotation containing a single
            paragraph. Well, not quite, since this is not <em>really</em>
            quoted text, but I hope you understand the point. After all, this
            page does not use HTML markup very normally anyway.</p></blockquote>

            <h2>Lists</h2>

            <p>This is a paragraph before an <strong>unnumbered</strong> list (<code>ul</code>). Note that
            the spacing between a paragraph and a list before or after that is hard
            to tune in a user style sheet. You can't guess which paragraphs are
            logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list header".</p>
            <ul>
              <li> One.
              <li> Two.
              <li> Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that
            for short items lists look better if they are compactly presented,
                   whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing between items.
              <li> Four. This is the last item in this list.
                   Let us terminate the list now without making any more fuss about it.
            </ul>
            <p>The following is a <code>menu</code> list:</p>
            <menu>
              <li> One.
              <li> Two.
              <li> Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer so that it will
            probably wrap to the next line in rendering.
            </menu>
            <p>The following is a <code>dir</code> list:</p>
            <dir>
              <li> One.
              <li> Two.
              <li> Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer so that it will
            probably wrap to the next line in rendering.
            </dir>

            <p>This is a paragraph before a <strong>numbered</strong> list (<code>ol</code>). Note that
            the spacing between a paragraph and a list before or after that is hard
            to tune in a user style sheet. You can't guess which paragraphs are
            logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list header".</p>
            <ol>
              <li> One.
              <li> Two.
              <li> Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that if
            items are short, lists look better if they are compactly presented,
                   whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing between items.
              <li> Four. This is the last item in this list.
                   Let us terminate the list now without making any more fuss about it.
            </ol>

            <p>This is a paragraph before a <strong>definition</strong> list (<code>dl</code>).
            In principle, such a list should consist of <em>terms</em> and associated
            definitions.
            But many authors use <code>dl</code> elements for fancy "layout" things. Usually the
            effect is not <em>too</em> bad, if you design user style sheet rules for <code>dl</code>
            which are suitable
            for real definition lists.

             <code>abbr</code> markup used)
              <li> <acronym title="radio detecting and ranging">radar</acronym> (an acronym; <code>acronym</code> markup used)
              <li> <b>bolded</b> (<code>b</code> markup used - just bolding with unspecified
                   semantics)
              <li> <big>big thing</big> (<code>big</code> markup used)
              <li> <cite>Origin of Species</cite> (a book title;
                   <code>cite</code> markup used)
              <li> <code>a[i] = b[i] + c[i);</code> (computer code; <code>code</code> markup used)
              <li> here we have some <del>deleted</del> text (<code>del</code> markup used)
              <li> an <dfn>octet</dfn> is an entity consisting of eight bits
                   (<code>dfn</code> markup used for the term being defined)

              <li> type <kbd>yes</kbd> when prompted for an answer (<code>kbd</code> markup
                   used for text indicating keyboard input)
              <li> <q>Hello!</q> (<code>q</code> markup used for quotation)
              <li> He said: <q>She said <q>Hello!</q></q> (a quotation inside a quotation)
              <li> you may get the message <samp>Core dumped</samp> at times

              <li> <small>this is not that important</small> (<code>small</code> markup used)
              <li> <strike>overstruck</strike> (<code>strike</code> markup used; note:
                   <code>s</code> is a nonstandard synonym for <code>strike</code>)
              <li> <strong>this is highlighted text</strong> (<code>strong</code>
                   markup used)
              <li> In order to test how subscripts and superscripts (<code>sub</code> and
                   <code>sup</code> markup) work inside running text, we need some
                   dummy text around constructs like x<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O
                   (where subscripts occur). So here is some fill so that
                   you will (hopefully) see whether and how badly the subscripts
                   and superscripts mess up vertical spacing between lines.
                   Now superscripts: M<sup>lle</sup>, 1<sup>st</sup>, and then some
                   mathematical notations: e<sup>x</sup>, sin<sup>2</sup> <i>x</i>,
                   and some nested superscripts (exponents) too:
                   e<sup>x<sup>2</sup></sup> and f(x)<sup>g(x)<sup>a+b+c</sup></sup>
                   (where 2 and a+b+c should appear as exponents of exponents).
              <li> <tt>text in monospace font</tt> (<code>tt</code> markup used)
              <li> <u>underlined</u> text (<code>u</code> markup used)
              <li> the command <code>cat</code> <var>filename</var> displays the
                   file specified by the <var>filename</var> (<code>var</code> markup
                   used to indicate a word as a variable).
            </ul>

            <p>Some of the elements tested above are typically displayed in a monospace
            font, often using the <em>same</em> presentation for all of them. This
            tests whether that is the case on your browser:</p>

            <ul>
              <li> <code>This is sample text inside code markup</code>
              <li> <kbd>This is sample text inside kbd markup</kbd>
              <li> <samp>This is sample text inside samp markup</samp>
              <li> <tt>This is sample text inside tt markup</tt>

            inline links. Generally, inline links (as opposite to e.g. links
            lists) are problematic
            from the
            <a href="http://www.useit.com">usability</a> perspective,

            <h2>Tables</h2>

            <p>The following table has a caption. The first row and the first column
            contain table header cells (<code>th</code> elements) only; other cells
            are data cells (<code>td</code> elements), with <code>align="right"</code>
            attributes:</p>

            annotations. If the browser&#8217;s default font does not
            contain all of them, they may get displayed using backup fonts.
            This may cause stylistic differences, but it should not
            prevent the characters from being displayed at all.</p>

            <table>
            <tr><th>Char. <th>Explanation <th>Notes
            <tr><td>ê <td>e with circumflex <td>Latin 1 character, should be ok

            <h2>Hyphenation</h2>
            <p>In the following, a width setting should cause some hyphenation,
